        <h3>About Me </h3>
        <article>Hi! my name is Merissa Bridgeman and welcome to my portfolio!
            A little bit about me is I was born December 13, 1998 in Berkeley but I live in Oakland, CA just right
            across the bridge from the city.
            I went to Oakland Tech for high school and graduated in 2017. I'm a current junior at Make School located in
            San Francisco, CA.
            I'm also a coFounder of a startup company called BuzzTrek. Below are some cool projects
            that I've worked on in the past few years and the skills I have gained
            from them. </article>

    <section id="Projects">
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> -Created an app that allows students
                to seek out resources and advice from peers
                on anything college related or outside
                factors that affect the college experience.
            </li>
            <li>-During a month long google cssi program
                I worked with a peer to create a simple
                trivia game.
            </li>
            <li>-Did a web internship at UC Berkeley in high school that became a program throughout the
                school year. This is where I solidified my interest in programming. At the end of the internship
                I created a basic website where users could find underground music artists.
